Description: VEMIRT is created to assist researchers in conducting exploratory and confirmatory multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) analysis and corresponding differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. The core computation engine of VEMIRT is a family of Gaussian Variational EM algorithms that are considerably more efficient than currently available algorithms in other software packages, especially when the number of latent factors exceeds four.
